# PRD: Agentic AI Platform for Enterprise

## Summary
We are building a custom **agentic AI solution** for enterprise customers.  
The opportunity is large and time-sensitive — adoption is accelerating, competition is limited, and we already hold a strong position.  

- **ROI**: 35%+ within 12 months  
- **Payback**: 8–12 months  
- **Differentiators**: Advanced workflow orchestration, 3rd-party integrations, robust infra (99.5% uptime)  

---

## Problem Statement
Enterprise adoption of AI-powered automation is growing rapidly. Current solutions lack accuracy, orchestration, and integration depth. Customers want reliable agentic AI that scales with their operations, integrates with existing workflows, and delivers measurable ROI.  

Our product will address these gaps while taking advantage of our market position and technical expertise.

## Goals

### Business Goals
- Achieve **35%+ ROI** within 12 months of launch  
- Reach **50 enterprise customers** in the first year  
- Establish **90% model accuracy** (vs. competitor avg. 80%)  
- Ensure **99.5% uptime SLA** to drive enterprise trust  

### User Goals
- Automate repetitive workflows with **high accuracy**  
- Reduce operational costs by at least **25%**  
- Integrate seamlessly with existing tools (Slack, Salesforce, Jira, etc.)  
- Access insights and automation in **<100ms response time**  

### Non-Goals
- Building consumer-facing AI chatbots  
- Supporting all possible languages at MVP launch  
- Offering custom fine-tuning for every client in early release

## User Stories
- *As an operations manager*, I want to automate reporting tasks so that my team saves 10+ hours/week.  
- *As a CIO*, I want guarantees of uptime and data security so I can trust deploying this across my enterprise.  
- *As an analyst*, I want AI to integrate with Salesforce and Jira so I don’t need to manually transfer data.  
- *As a CTO*, I want predictable cost per query so I can budget confidently.  

---

## User Experience Flow
1. **Onboarding** → Customer connects existing enterprise tools via integrations  
2. **Setup** → Admins configure workflows (drag-and-drop orchestration UI)  
3. **Execution** → AI agents execute tasks with real-time monitoring  
4. **Monitoring & Reporting** → Dashboards show accuracy, cost savings, and ROI  
5. **Scaling** → Load balancing and orchestration auto-scale based on demand  

---

## Narrative
In 2025, enterprise adoption of agentic AI solutions is projected to hit **50%**. Today, only two competitors exist, holding less than 50% market share combined.  

Our solution offers **90% accuracy**, outperforming their 80% benchmark. Within months post-MVP, we expect to improve accuracy by another 10%, ensuring leadership.  

Financially:
- Price: **$20/seat/month**  
- Avg. cost: **$12/seat/month**  
- Upfront investment: **$2M**  
- Projected ROI: **35%+**  
- Payback: **8 months (11–12 under stress tests)**  

By combining a high-performing technical stack (load balancers, orchestrators, caching layer) with smart sequencing of features (prioritizing **advanced workflow orchestration** and **3rd-party integrations**), we will meet both market urgency and enterprise-grade expectations.

## Success Metrics
- ROI > 35% within 12 months  
- Payback < 12 months even under cost sensitivity  
- SLA uptime 99.5%+  
- Accuracy ≥ 90% by launch; +10% in 6 months  
- <100ms response latency  
- 50 enterprise clients onboarded in first year  

---

## Technical Considerations

### Infrastructure
- Auto-scaling load balancers at 80% CPU threshold  
- Minimum 3 orchestrators for redundancy  
- Scalable caching layer to reduce query latency  

### Cost per Query
- Avg query: **50 words (~75 tokens)**  
- Avg output: **150 tokens**  
- Total: ~225 tokens/query  
- LLM cost (OpenAI): **$0.002/query**  
- Infra overhead: **$0.001/query**  
- **Total: $0.003/query**  
- At 50 queries/user/day → **$3.75/month per user cost**  

### Risk Management
- API latency risk mitigated with caching  
- Outage risk mitigated with orchestrators + auto-recovery
